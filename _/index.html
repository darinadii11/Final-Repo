                Casa Milà, popularly known as La Pedrera or "The stone quarry", a reference to its unconventional rough-hewn appearance, is a modernist building in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was the last private residence designed by architect Antoni Gaudí and was built between 1906 and 1912.

                Casa Batlló is a building in the center of Barcelona. It was designed by Antoni Gaudí, and is considered one of his masterpieces. A remodel of a previously built house, it was redesigned in 1904 by Gaudí and has been refurbished several times after that. The local name for the building is Casa dels ossos (House of Bones), as it has a visceral, skeletal organic quality.

                From the outside the façade of Casa Batlló looks like it has been made from skulls and bones. The "Skulls" are in fact balconies and the "bones" are supporting pillars.Gaudí used colours and shapes found in marine life as inspiration for his creativity in this building e.g. the colours chosen for the façade are those found in natural coral.

                The facade is divided into three distinct sections, each reflecting a level of anatomy. The base level looks as though it is gridded by huge abstract bones, while above that the front takes on a more chaotic, abstract pattern echoing blood vessels and muscle, and then the entire structure is capped with a scaly roof section that looks like nothing so much as the back of a giant dragon.

                The columns of the interior are a unique Gaudí design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. This effect is the result of a three-dimensional intersection of helicoidal columns.

                Gaudí was a great fan of God and he incorporated religion into both the interior and exterior of the Sagrada Familia. The basilica has no straight lines and everything has been built with the objective of imitating mother nature. With the different columns and the stained glass windows, Gaudí tried to make the inside of the Sagrada Familia resemble a forest. The conception of Gaudí on the Sagrada Familia is derived from the traditions of the Gothic and Byzantine cathedrals.

                The inside columns are made of materials of different hardness. The longest and thickest columns are made of a very hard volcanic rock called red porphyry. These columns carry the 5 towers in the middle of the Sagrada Familia. The smaller and dark columns are made of basalt. The granite columns support the light and outer row columns in the basilica and consist of a relatively soft rock from Montjuïc in Barcelona. The smallest columns support the choir - which is behind the transept and before the altar.

                The construction of the structure began in 1882. It was designed initially in a Neo-Gothic style. A year later it was commissioned to the Spanish Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, who redesigned it entirely. He drafted a remarkable and original basilica that was to have 18 towers. However, he died before he could complete this chef d’oeuvre, having only built one of the church’s towers.

                Although it isn’t completed, the Sagrada Familia is an impressive temple packed with religious symbolism. These are some of its most splendid components:Towers.
Currently, eight of the eighteen towers have been completed. Gaudí had planned for 12 of them to be built in memory of the Disciples, four to commemorate the Evangelists, one in memory of Mary, mother of Jesus and another in dedicated to Jesus Christ. Each tower’s height will depend on the religious hierarchy they represent.

                Façades
The Basilica has three symbolic façades:

Nativity Façade: The façade represents Christ’s birth. It is beautifully decorated and full of life.
Passion Façade:  This part of the Basilica is a little more bare and simple than the rest of the façades. It represents the suffering of Jesus during his Crucifixion.
Glory Façade: This is the main façade, which is larger and more spectacular. It symbolizes Jesus’ death and resurrection and his present and future Glory. Aware that he wasn’t going to be able to finish it, Gaudí left several sketches so that his successors could finish the work correctly.

                Gaudí was deeply influenced by nature and its many forms. Inside the Basilica, he designed the pillars in the shape of elegant and slender tree trunks, creating a concrete forest in the temple’s interior.

                One of the most common questions related to the Sagrada Familia is when will the structure will be completed. This is a difficult question to answer. Since it was founded in 1882, it has been built thanks to donations. This is why the Sagrada Família is taking so long to complete and it could take several years to finish.
